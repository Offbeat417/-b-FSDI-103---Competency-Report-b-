        <div class="text location">
            <p class="paragraph">Oculus Quest is a product designed to give users a virtual reality experience. Whether you want to watch movies, play video games, or do work on your computer, the Quest can take care of it all.</p>
        </div>

    <h3 class="header1">What's the difference? Why this one?</h3>

    <p>It's no secret that virtual reality has existed for quite a while now. Many different companies have tried their hand at this in many different industries. These companies have even released new generations of hardware and software to keep up with the many changes that have become available over time- and the Quest is one of them.</p>

    <p>Unlike its predecessors, the Oculus Quest is able to run without the need of plugging into a computer, nor does it need external sensors. Everything that is needed to have an enjoyable experience is already apart of the headset that comes in the package when you buy. All you need to do is take care of the initial set up, and you're good to go.</p>

    <img src="Quest3.jpg" alt="Quest">
    <h4 class="header1">Here's what we know. . .</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">We know that the Quest comes at roughly the same price as the Rift S, another version of Oculus. While that may seem daunting a bit to some, the reality is that you still save money with the Quest versus the Rift S, becuase the Rift S still needs to be run on a computer- a high end, more expensive computer at that.</p>

    <h3 class="header1"> So Who Is this For?</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">This incredible tool is meant for individuals who don't plan on spending an arm and a leg to have fun with virtual reality. If you want to play games and watch videos casually, or if you don't already have a high end computer that can run a Rift S, this is for you.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="paragraph">The graphics and the overall experience may be a little less than other products that attempt to do the same thing, I'll admit. Despite that, however, the overall experience is just as good. The difference between the two at the end of the day is how much money you're willing to spend on your experience.</p>


    <h3 class="header1">When Should I buy??</h3>
    <img src="blackfriday.jpg" alt="blackfriday">
    <p class="paragraph">So you're interested in the experience, now what? While the quest is meant more for the the casual gamers, it can still be fairly expensive to get into. So, what do you do? Sales. 

        Black Friday is going to be your best bet to save a pretty penny on your investment. While it's a couple months away, and you're purchase is more than likely going to be behind thousands of other people wanting the same thing, this will still be your best bet.

        Think of it like this: You could either pay full price right now for this item, or you could play the waiting game a while and save.
